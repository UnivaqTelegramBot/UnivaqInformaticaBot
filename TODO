### TODO

Functional:

0. Change bot from univaq_informatica_bot to univaq
1. Implement univaq, mesvaq e discab
2. Change db structure from:
    {
        "_id" : ObjectId("59598f9dc66fc42740e26ff6"),
        "telegramID" : 180852051
    }
   to:
   {
        "_id" : ObjectId("59598f9dc66fc42740e26ff6"),
        "telegramID" : 180852051,
        "sezioni": {
          "disim": 1,
          "univaq": 1
        }
    }
3. If there are more spots to scrape inside one section we use a keyboard to let people chose the one they want
4. Check the import of packages and avoid use of sys.path.insert(0, '../')

Non functional:

1. Implement in some way (maybe scraping pdf documents) the lessons timetables with their notifications.
2. Need to change the feedback command in a conversation
