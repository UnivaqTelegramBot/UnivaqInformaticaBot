1. We'll use pip as package manager just to make easier the deploy process. So since our goal is not to let others install easily the application but to let us get easily the required libraries, we'll not really use a setup.py file, but just a requirements.txt as common practice and as specified in the pip documentation.

  1. So to install the dependencies of the project folder this is enough: pip install -r requirements.txt

2. To create "physically" the bot and get an API key we use BotFather as suggested by the wrapper we're using.

  1. BotFather - https://core.telegram.org/bots#botfather
     -IMPORTANT-

     This is the bot we'll use for testing and deploy (I created it now to occupy the username):

     Name: Univaq Informatica
     Username: univaq_informatica_bot
     Telegram Url: tg://resolve?domain=univaq_informatica_bot

  2. Wrapper documentation - https://github.com/python-telegram-bot/python-telegram-bot
